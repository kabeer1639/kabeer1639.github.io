1. Machine Learning and Cybersecurity
 let’s look at the common cybersecurity tasks and machine learning opportunities. There are three dimensions (Why, What, and How).
The first dimension is a task (e.g., detect threats, predict attacks, etc.). According to Gartner’s PPDR model, all security tasks can be divided into five categories:
prediction;
prevention;
detection;
response;
monitoring.
The second dimension is a technical layer and an answer to the “What” question (e.g., at which level to monitor issues). Here is the list of layers for this dimension:
network (network traffic analysis and intrusion detection);
endpoint (anti-malware);
application (WAF or database firewalls);
user (UBA);
process (anti-fraud).
The third dimension is a question of “How” (e.g., how to check security of a particular area):
in transit in real time;
at rest;
historically;


2. What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.
These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.
Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative
What is the relation between Machine Learning and Cybersecurity?

3. Why machine learning ?

Applying AI
techniques to threat intelligence provides new sensing
capabilities which work at scale and can be applied to
new domains like predicting future cyber threats
Alongside  of  fast  evolvement  of  web  and  mobile technologies,  attack  techniques  are  also  becoming  more and more sophisticated in penetrating systems and evading generic  signature-based  approaches.  Machine  learning techniques offer  potential solutions that can  be employed for resolving such challenging and complex situations due to  their  ability  to  adapt  quickly  to  new  and  unknown circumstances.  
Diverse  machine  learning  methods  have been  successfully  deployed  to  address  wide-ranging problems in computer and information security
Machine learning techniques have been applied in many areas of science due to their unique properties like adaptability, scalability, and potential to rapidly adjust to new and unknown challenges. 
Cyber security is a fast-growing field demanding a great deal of attention because of remarkable progresses in social networks, cloud and web technologies, online banking, mobile environment, smart grid, etc.
Diverse machine learning methods have been successfully deployed to address such wide-ranging problems in computer security
Machine  learning  is  an  effective  tool  that  can  be employed  in  many  areas  of  information  security.  There exist  some  robust  anti-phishing  algorithms  and  network intrusion  detection  systems.  Machine  learning  can  be successfully  used  for  developing  authentication  systems, evaluating  the  protocol  implementation,  assessing  the security  of  human  interaction  proofs,  smart  meter  data profiling,  etc.  Although  machine  learning  facilitates keeping  various  systems  safe,  the  machine  learning classifiers themselves are  vulnerable to malicious attacks. There  has  been  some  work  directed  to  improving  the effectiveness  of  machine  learning  algorithms  and protecting  them  from  diverse  attacks.
There  are  many opportunities  in  information  security  to  apply  machine learning  to  address  various  challenges  in  such  complex domain. Spam detection, virus detection,  and surveillance camera robbery detection are only some examples.
